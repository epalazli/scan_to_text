# scan_to_text

This code reads the texts of PDF files and saves them translated in a .docx file.
Each step works automatically after selecting the PDFs. 

There are two important points that make the code work well:
1. the scanned document should be scanned as good as possible. 
The better the quality of the scanned PDF file, the better the text recognition will work.

2. DeepL is the best translator in my opinion. But it can translate only a few languages.
So if you need to translate to or from a language that is not supported by DeepL, 
you will get a worse translated text.

Languages like Turkish or Arabic are translated with the standard Google Translator.
