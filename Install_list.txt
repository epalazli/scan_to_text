1st of all Download Poppler from here here,Then extract it.
In the code section just add poppler_path=r'C:\Program Files\poppler-0.68.0\bin'(for eg.) like below:

###
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
images = convert_from_path("mypdf.pdf", 500,poppler_path=r'C:\Program Files\poppler-0.68.0\bin')
for i, image in enumerate(images):
    fname = 'image'+str(i)+'.png'
    image.save(fname, "PNG")

I see steps are scattered in different answers. Based on my recent experience with this pytesseract error on Windows, writing different steps in sequence to make it easier to resolve the error:

1. Install tesseract using windows installer available at: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

2. Note the tesseract path from the installation. Default installation path at the time of this edit was: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Tesseract-OCR. It may change so please check the installation path.

3. pip install pytesseract and pip install tesseract

4. Set the tesseract path in the script before calling image_to_string. Put it in the line before using pytesseract:

pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'

### Tesseract: other languages

The Tesseract installer provided by Chocolatey currently includes only English language. 
To install other languages, download the respective language pack (.traineddata file) 
from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/ and 
place it in C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tessdata (or wherever Tesseract OCR is installed).
